EdTech Integration Hub
Overview
The EdTech Integration Hub is a blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate the integration and management of various educational technology (EdTech) tools. By leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology, this platform provides a decentralized solution for managing tool access, recording interactions, and ensuring secure data exchanges between educational institutions, teachers, and students.

Features
Tool Registration: EdTech providers can register their tools on the blockchain, ensuring a secure and immutable record of their offerings.
Access Control: Tool owners can grant or revoke access to their tools for specific users, such as educators or students, directly on the blockchain.
Tool Management: Owners can deactivate or reactivate their tools at any time, providing flexible control over tool availability.
User Verification: A built-in mechanism to verify whether a user has access to a specific tool.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To deploy and interact with the EdTech Integration Hub smart contract, you'll need:

Solidity: Version 0.8.0 or higher
Node.js: Version 12.x or higher
Truffle or Hardhat: For smart contract deployment and testing
Ganache: For local Ethereum blockchain testing
MetaMask: For interacting with the deployed contract
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edtech-integration-hub.git
cd edtech-integration-hub
Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Compile the Smart Contract

Compile the Solidity smart contract using Truffle or Hardhat:

bash
Copy code
truffle compile
# or
npx hardhat compile
Deploy the Contract

Deploy the smart contract to your local blockchain:

bash
Copy code
truffle migrate
# or
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
Interact with the Contract

You can interact with the deployed contract using a frontend application, command-line tools, or directly through your preferred blockchain interface (e.g., Remix or MetaMask).

Usage
Registering a Tool
Tool owners can register their tools on the platform by invoking the registerTool function. This requires specifying the tool's name and a brief description.

solidity
Copy code
function registerTool(string memory _name, string memory _description) public;
Granting and Revoking Access
Tool owners can grant or revoke access to their tools for specific users.

solidity
Copy code
function grantAccess(uint256 _toolId, address _user) public;
function revokeAccess(uint256 _toolId, address _user) public;
Managing Tool Availability
Tool owners can deactivate or reactivate their tools as needed.

solidity
Copy code
function deactivateTool(uint256 _toolId) public;
function reactivateTool(uint256 _toolId) public;
Checking User Access
Anyone can verify whether a user has access to a specific tool using the hasAccess function.

solidity
Copy code
function hasAccess(uint256 _toolId, address _user) public view returns (bool);
