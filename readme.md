EdTech Integration Hub

Overview
The EdTech Integration Hub is a blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate the integration and management of various educational technology (EdTech) tools. By leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology, this platform provides a decentralized solution for managing tool access, recording interactions, and ensuring secure data exchanges between educational institutions, teachers, and students.

Features
  Tool Registration: EdTech providers can register their tools on the blockchain, ensuring a secure and immutable record of their offerings.
  Access Control: Tool owners can grant or revoke access to their tools for specific users, such as educators or students, directly on the blockchain.
  Tool Management: Owners can deactivate or reactivate their tools at any time, providing flexible control over tool availability.
  User Verification: A built-in mechanism to verify whether a user has access to a specific tool.

Getting Started
  Prerequisites
    To deploy and interact with the EdTech Integration Hub smart contract, you'll need:
      1) Solidity: Version 0.8.0 or higher
      2) Node.js: Version 12.x or higher
      3) Truffle or Hardhat: For smart contract deployment and testing
      4) Ganache: For local Ethereum blockchain testing
      5) MetaMask: For interacting with the deployed contract

3) cd edtech-integration-hub
4) Install Dependencies
5) Install the required Node.js packages:
    npm install
6) Compile the Smart Contract

7) Compile the Solidity smart contract using Truffle or Hardhat:
    truffle compile
    # or
    npx hardhat compile

8) Deploy the Contract

9) Deploy the smart contract to your local blockchain:

Usage
Registering a Tool
Tool owners can register their tools on the platform by invoking the registerTool function. This requires specifying the tool's name and a brief description.

function registerTool(string memory _name, string memory _description) public;
Granting and Revoking Access
Tool owners can grant or revoke access to their tools for specific users.


function grantAccess(uint256 _toolId, address _user) public;
function revokeAccess(uint256 _toolId, address _user) public;
Managing Tool Availability
Tool owners can deactivate or reactivate their tools as needed.



function deactivateTool(uint256 _toolId) public;
function reactivateTool(uint256 _toolId) public;


Checking User Access
Anyone can verify whether a user has access to a specific tool using the hasAccess function.


function hasAccess(uint256 _toolId, address _user) public view returns (bool);
